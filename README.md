Fire Alarm System
Welcome to the Fire Alarm System project! This project aims to design and implement an efficient and reliable fire alarm system that can be used to detect and respond to potential fire hazards in various environments, such as homes, offices, industrial facilities, and more.

Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Early Fire Detection: The project aims to provide an early warning system that can detect the presence of a fire or smoke as quickly as possible, minimizing the risk of damage and ensuring the safety of occupants.

Real-Time Monitoring: We aim to create a system that continuously monitors the environment for fire-related events in real-time. This includes detecting smoke, elevated temperatures, or other indicators of a fire outbreak.

Alerting Mechanisms: The project will implement alerting mechanisms to promptly notify users or responsible authorities when a fire or potential fire hazard is detected. This may include alarms, notifications via mobile apps or email, and visual indicators.

User-Friendly Interface: We are committed to developing a user-friendly dashboard or interface that provides clear and concise information about the status of the fire alarm system, including sensor data, alerts, and system health.

Scalability and Customization: The system will be designed with scalability in mind, allowing users to expand or customize the system to suit their specific needs and environments.

Data Logging and Analysis: The project will include a feature for logging sensor data and fire-related events, which can be useful for post-incident analysis and compliance reporting.
